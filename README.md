# Welcome to the GitHub Workflow Class

Follow the directions from the class in this repo.

Once you've completed a step, check back at the Wheelhouse class to see whether you completed it correctly.

Happy learning!

## Workflow class is a major improvement from prior GitHub training grounds; however, it is unclear that it is creating a Repo <b>and</b> that you are to navigate in a new window or tab. This equals about 5 seconds of confusion. 

The checking progress has issues if you follow along during a video; you must manually select "task completed" (or whatever the designated terminology is); as, it doesn't see completed work unless you've clicked through to the next page - the two pages should be combined with the video at the top and the checklist below; this way it can be accomplished in one, potentially, segmented 'step'.

## Also, there is repeated scrolling back to the top of the page in order to click through to the next step; this is time wasting and redundant over the course of 10 pages; as are some of the descriptions. Branch, PR, Merge with create file, edit, & comment interspersed.

### What is lacking is any direction on how to delete the branch.

# I Simply expected more; although, design and feel is very nice, the flow needs adjusting.
